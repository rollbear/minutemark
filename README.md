# minutemark
A simple graph to mark minute lines on a map given a known ground speed

If you're an aviator using printed maps, getting minute marks along your planned route is useful, and unfortunately tedious. To make it less tedious, print this postscript documnt, fold it along your calculated ground speed, and each line is one minute on a 1:250000 map. If you want it for different map scales, edit the line `scale 250000 def` to refer to your map scale.
